NOTE: Out of necessity for this to run without a server side component, I implemented all the clustering algorithms in Javascript myself.
While I believe my code to be correct, in no way did I focus on it being optimized for speed / runtime.  If you plan to use my code for a
project that is allowed given it's license, you may find opportunities for code optimizations that would greatly improve performance.  I
would gladly accept pull requests for such enhancements.  Further, my objective was more "get it done" than "make it pretty".  While I
believe the code is readable, I did a few sloppy things here and there with scoping to get things done quickly.
